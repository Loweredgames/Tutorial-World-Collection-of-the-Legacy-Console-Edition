# Tutorial World Collection of the Legacy Console Edition

I have created a collection that brings together all tutorial worlds of the Legacy Console Edition. there are all tutorial worlds from TU 1 to TU 69 updated to the latest version of the Java Edition (1.13.2+ from TU3 to TU19) and (1.17.1+ from TU31 to TU69, the minigame hub is also included). also the Bedrock Edition (Latest version).

 

converted and updated by The Architect of Minecraft (thanks for making the videos. watch them if you want to see the original version)

 

*These worlds are very ancient and have been ported to another edition and therefore may contain errors and be unstable.*
